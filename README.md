## About This Repository 📚

Welcome to the **Problem Solving with C++** repository! This repo is dedicated to showcasing my journey of learning C++ through quizzes, exercises, and practice problems from [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/). Here, you'll find a collection of solutions that I've crafted while progressing through the course, aimed at mastering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++.

## Repository Structure 🗂️

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific chapter or topic from LearnCpp.com. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- **Problem Statements:** The original problem or quiz from the course.
- **My Solutions:** The C++ code files that contain my solutions to these problems.
- **Explanations:** A brief description or comment section within the code to explain the logic and approach used to solve the problem.

Here's an example of the structure:

├── Chapter01-Basics
│ ├── problem1.cpp
│ ├── problem2.cpp
│ └── ...
├── Chapter02-Control-Flow
│ ├── problem1.cpp
│ ├── problem2.cpp
│ └── ...
└── README.md

## Learning Journey 📈

As I progress through the course, I will continuously update this repository with new problems and solutions. This not only helps me track my learning but also serves as a resource for others who are on a similar learning path.

## Sample Problem & Solution 🌟

### Problem: [Basic Input/Output](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/basic-input-and-output/)

**Description:** Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and prints it back.

**Solution:** Check out the solution below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number;
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    std::cin >> number;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
