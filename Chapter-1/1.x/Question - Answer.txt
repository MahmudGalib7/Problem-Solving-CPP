Question #1

What is the difference between initialization and assignment?

Solution:

Initialization provides a variable with an initial value (at the point of creation). Assignment gives a variable a new value after the variable has already been defined.

Question #2

When does undefined behavior occur? What are the consequences of undefined behavior?

Solution: Undefined behavior occurs when the programmer does something that is ill-specified by the C++ language. The consequences could be almost anything, from crashing to producing the wrong answer to working correctly anyway.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then enter a second number. The program should tell the user what the result of adding and subtracting the two numbers is.

The output of the program should match the following (assuming inputs of 6 and 4):

Enter an integer: 6
Enter another integer: 4
6 + 4 is 10.
6 - 4 is 2.
Hint: To print a period and a newline, use ".\n", not '.\n'.

Solution:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    int x{}, y{};

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> x;

    cout << "Enter another integer: ";
    cin >> y;

    cout << x << " + " << y << " is " << x + y << endl;
    cout << x << " - " << y << " is " << x - y << endl;

    return 0;
}
