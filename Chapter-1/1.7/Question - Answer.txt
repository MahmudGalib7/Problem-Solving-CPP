Question #1

Based on how you should name a variable, indicate whether each variable name is conventional (follows best practices), unconventional (compiler will accept but does not follow best practices), or invalid (will not compile), and why.

int sum {};

(Assume it’s obvious what we’re summing)
Solution : Conventional.

int _apples {};
Solution : Unconventional -- variable names should not start with an underscore.

int VALUE {};
Solution : Unconventional -- single word names should be in all lower case.

int my variable name {};
Solution : Invalid -- variable names can not contain spaces.

int TotalCustomers {};
Solution : Unconventional -- variable names should start with a lower case letter.

int void {};
Solution : Invalid -- void is a keyword.

int numFruit {};
Solution : Conventional.

int 3some {};
Solution : Invalid -- variable names can not start with a number.

int meters_of_pipe {};
Solution : Conventional
