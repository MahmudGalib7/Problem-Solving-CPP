Question #1

What is an uninitialized variable? Why should you avoid using them?

Solution :-An uninitialized variable is a variable that has not been given a value by the program (generally through initialization or assignment). Using the value stored in an uninitialized variable will result in undefined behavior.

Question #2

What is undefined behavior, and what can happen if you do something that exhibits undefined behavior?

Solution:- Undefined behavior is the result of executing code whose behavior is not well defined by the language. The result can be almost anything, including something that behaves correctly.
