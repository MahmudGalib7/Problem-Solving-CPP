Question #1

What is the difference between initialization and assignment?

Solution:- Initialization gives a variable an initial value at the point when it is created. Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the variable is created.

Question #2

What form of initialization should you prefer when you want to initialize a variable with a specific value?

Solution:- Direct list initialization (aka. direct brace initialization)

Question #3

What are default initialization and value initialization? What is the behavior of each? Which should you prefer?

Solution:- Default initialization is when a variable initialization has no initializer (e.g. int x;). In most cases, the variable is left with an indeterminate value.

Value initialization is when a variable initialization has an empty brace (e.g. int x{};). In most cases this will perform zero-initialization.

You should prefer value initialization to default initialization.
