Question #1

Write a single-file program (named main.cpp) that reads two separate integers from the user, adds them together, and then outputs the answer. The program should use three functions:

A function named “readNumber” should be used to get (and return) a single integer from the user.
A function named “writeAnswer” should be used to output the answer. This function should take a single parameter and have no return value.
A main() function should be used to glue the above functions together.

Solution:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int readNumber() {
    int number;
    cout << "Enter a integer: ";
    cin >> number;

    return number;
}

int writeAnswer(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

int main() {
    int num1;
    int num2;

    num1 = readNumber();
    num2 = readNumber();
    cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " & " << num2 << " is " << writeAnswer(num1,num2);

    return 0;
}


Question #2

Modify the program you wrote in exercise #1 so that readNumber() and writeAnswer() live in a separate file called “io.cpp”. Use a forward declaration to access them from main().

If you’re having problems, make sure “io.cpp” is properly added to your project so it gets compiled.

Solution:

main.cpp:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int writeAnswer(int num1, int num2);
int readNumber();

int main() {
    int num1;
    int num2;

    num1 = readNumber();
    num2 = readNumber();
    cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " & " << num2 << " is " << writeAnswer(num1,num2);

    return 0;
}

io.cpp:


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int readNumber() {
    int number;
    cout << "Enter a integer: ";
    cin >> number;

    return number;
}

int writeAnswer(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}



Question #3

Modify the program you wrote in #2 so that it uses a header file (named io.h) to access the functions instead of using forward declarations directly in your code (.cpp) files. Make sure your header file uses header guards.

If you compile your program and get errors like one of these:

unresolved external symbol "int __cdecl readNumber(void)" (?readNumber@@YAHXZ)
undefined reference to `readNumber()'
Then you probably forgot to include io.cpp in your project, so the definitions for readNumber() (and writeAnswer()) aren’t being compiled into your project.

Solution:

main.cpp:

#include <iostream>
#include "io.h"
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1;
    int num2;

    num1 = readNumber();
    num2 = readNumber();
    cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " & " << num2 << " is " << writeAnswer(num1, num2);

    return 0;
}

io.cpp:


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int readNumber() {
    int number;
    cout << "Enter a integer: ";
    cin >> number;

    return number;
}

int writeAnswer(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

io.h:

#ifndef IO_H
#define IO_H

int readNumber();
int writeAnswer(int num1, int num2);

#endif
